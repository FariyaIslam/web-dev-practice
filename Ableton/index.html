            Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by a
            community of dedicated musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

            Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly
            rewarding.

        <div class="paragraph__2">
            We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what
            we make, and the people we make it for.

    <div class="paragraph__section">
        <div class="paragraph__1">
            We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our
            offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.

        <div class="paragraph__2">
            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come
            from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and
            most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills
            and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.

            strive to make them great.

        <div class="paragraph__2">
            Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic
            and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse,
            and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other,
            but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

            Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively supported in acquiring new knowledge and
            skills, and coached on applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized development and
            music salons are a chance to discuss new technologies, production techniques and best practices.

            If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. We’ll even provide you with free
            German or English lessons. Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for
            you and your family, as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, but it’s
            not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year as well as a variety of fun,
            informal small-group activities.
